# Project Description
JumpMania Portal is a gaming web platform that offers players a comprehensive experience with account logins, personalized profiles, and progress tracking. The portal features JumpMaster, a Doodle Jump-inspired game where players ascend through endless platforms, collect power-ups, and avoid obstacles. Players can create accounts to save their game progress, track high scores, and customize their gaming experience. The portal aims to deliver engaging arcade-style gameplay with the added benefit of user profiles, leaderboards, and social interaction.

## Account Logins & Player Profiles: 
Players can create personalized accounts to store their progress, high scores, and achievements. The account system also allows for the saving of game data such as unlocked skins and power-ups. Players can manage their profiles and view stats like games played and top scores.

## Game Integration 
JumpMaster: The core game, JumpMaster, is seamlessly integrated into the portal. Players can access the game through their profiles and have their scores automatically saved to the leaderboard. Power-ups, skins, and other in-game items are linked to their accounts for future sessions.

## Endless Vertical Gameplay
Players navigate a character that continually jumps from platform to platform, with the goal of reaching the highest possible score. Platforms are dynamically generated as the player ascends, keeping the gameplay fresh.

## Responsive Design
JumpMaster is optimized for play on both desktop and mobile browsers. The responsive design ensures the game looks and performs well on any device, whether played in landscape or portrait mode.
